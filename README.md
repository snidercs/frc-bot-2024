## Example Code

FRC provides [several examples](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/tree/main/wpilibcExamples/src/main/cpp/examples) of how to utilize WPIlib on GitHub.  It is easier, and faster to copy and paste from these rather than generate new projects all the time.

## Simulation
Bot simulation is available in a few ways...

### Basic Simulator
This is the data-based simulator panel.

```bash
# run this from the command line to start the basic simulator
