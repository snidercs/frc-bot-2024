# Bot 2024

## Building
Build all targets, and run the simulator.
```bash
./gradlew build
```

## Deployment
Run the following command to deploy code to the roboRIO
```bash
./gradlew deploy
```

If it gives problems, cleaning the project could help. The `--info` option could give more information too.
```bash
./gradlew clean
./gradlew deploy --info

```

## Other Useful Terminal Commands
Useful Commands to Understand
```bash
./git status -a    //Shows the status of all git branches
./git checkout .   //Resets current changes on the branch
./git checkout new_branch_name    //Switches branches to new_branch_name from a different branch
./git pull //Pulls new code onto the branch
```

## Simulation
Bot simulation is available in a few ways...

**IMPORTANT**: The `Map gamepad` in the controllers list must be checked to mock the real bot.

### Basic Simulator
This is the data-based simulator panel.

```bash
# run this from the command line to start the basic simulator
./gradlew simulateNative
```

### Extern Sim With Real Driver Station

```bash
./gradlew simulateExternalNativeDebug
```
or
```bash
./gradlew simulateExternalNativeRelease
```

## Example Code

FRC provides [several examples](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/tree/main/wpilibcExamples/src/main/cpp/examples) of how to utilize WPIlib on GitHub.  It is easier, and faster to copy and paste from these rather than generate new projects all the time.
